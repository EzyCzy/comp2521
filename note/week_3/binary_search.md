Binary tree is where each node has atmost two child nodes
binary search tree is an ordered binary tree (left is lesser, right is greater)

Used for large amount of data

Previously we've done
- Ordered Array
  - Search O(log n) binary search
  - Insert O(n) shifting
- Ordered linked list
  - Search O(n)
  - Insert O(1) no shifting

Binary search trees maintains O(log n) search and O(1) insertion

root node - node with no parent node
leaf node - node with no child nodes
internal node - node that has atleast one child node

in-degree
in(v)
the number of incoming edges to a vertex

out-degree
out(v)
the number of outgoing edges from a vertex

A directed path is a sequence of vertices where each vertex has an outgoing edge
to the next vertex in the sequence

if there exist a directed path from v to w, then w is reachable from v
directed cycle first and last vertices are the same

Strongly connected if there is a direct path from every vertex to every other vertex

A strongly-connected component is a maximally strongly connected subgraph

A digraph that is not strongly connected has two or more strongly-connected components

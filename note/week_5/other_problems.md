Intractable no known efficient algorithm to solve them

Efficient -> polynomial time

A tractable problem is one that is known to have a polynomial-time solution

Tractable
- shortest path between two vertices
- does graph contain a clique
- two colour, is it possible to colour every vertex in a graph such that no
two adjacent vertices are the same colour
- graph contain an eulerian path?

Intractable
- longest path?
- largest clique?
- three colours?
- Hamiltonian path?

Graph isomorphism:
can we make two given graphs identical by renaming vertices?
